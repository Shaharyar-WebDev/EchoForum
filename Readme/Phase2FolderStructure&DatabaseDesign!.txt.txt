ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: Folder Structure & Database Design
Mission Objective: Implement a scalable architecture and fully normalized database.

âœ… Folder Structure (MVC Architecture)
A well-organized project prevents technical debt and keeps logic separate from UI.

âœ… Why This Structure?

Follows MVC for clean separation of concerns.
Security-focused: Middleware handles authentication & protection.
Scalability-ready: Organized for future expansions.
âœ… Database Schema (Fully Normalized)
Each table is optimized for relational integrity and performance.

ðŸ—ƒ Key Tables
Table	Purpose
users	Stores user details & roles
categories	Organizes discussions
threads	Stores user-created discussion topics
replies	Stores comments on threads
likes	Manages upvotes/downvotes on posts
notifications	Tracks user mentions & interactions
âœ… Best Practices Applied:

Foreign Keys for relational integrity.
Indexes on frequently queried fields.
Prepared Statements to prevent SQL injection.
