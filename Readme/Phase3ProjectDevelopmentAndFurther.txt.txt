DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: User Authentication & Security
Mission Objective: Implement a secure signup & login system.

âœ… Features
Register/Login System (Using password_hash() for security)
Session-Based Authentication (Stored securely)
Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Moderator, User)
CSRF Protection (Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery)
Rate Limiting (Prevent brute force attacks)
âœ… Best Practices:

Use password_hash() for secure password storage.
Implement CSRF tokens on all forms.
Limit login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
Use HTTPS for encrypted data transmission.
ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: User Profiles & Profile System
Mission Objective: Create detailed user profiles where users can view their activity.

âœ… Profile Page Includes
User Info (Username, Role, Bio, Location, Profile Picture)
List of Userâ€™s Threads
List of Userâ€™s Replies
Upvotes & Reputation System
Profile Picture Upload System
âœ… Best Practices:

Sanitize all user inputs (htmlspecialchars()) to prevent XSS.
Limit profile picture uploads to safe file types (JPG, PNG, etc.).
Ensure users cannot modify other users' profiles.
Use a default.png fallback for missing profile pictures.
ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Threaded Discussions & Replies
Mission Objective: Implement categories, topics, replies, and threaded discussions.

âœ… Features
Users can create threads under categories.
Other users can reply to discussions.
Thread pagination for scalability.
Pinned & Locked Threads (Moderation).
âœ… Best Practices:

Sanitize all user input to prevent SQL injection & XSS.
Use AJAX for real-time comment posting.
Allow users to edit/delete their posts (with a time limit).
ðŸ“Œ Phase 4: Upvotes & Notifications
Mission Objective: Implement user engagement features.

âœ… Features
Upvote System (Users can like posts).
Users get notifications when their posts are replied to.
Mention System (@username to notify users).
âœ… Best Practices:

Prevent duplicate upvotes using unique constraints.
Use LIMIT on notifications to prevent spam.
Store notifications efficiently to reduce query load.
ðŸ“Œ Phase 5: Admin Panel & Moderation
Mission Objective: Give admins & moderators tools to manage the forum.

âœ… Features
Admin Dashboard (Analytics & User Management).
Moderators can lock/pin threads.
Moderators can delete inappropriate content.
âœ… Best Practices:

Use role-based access control (role ENUM('user', 'moderator', 'admin')).
Moderators should not have full admin privileges.
Logs should track all moderator/admin actions.
ðŸ“Œ Phase 6: Optimization & Security Hardening
Mission Objective: Ensure maximum security and performance before deployment.

âœ… Security Hardening
Input Validation & Sanitization (Prevent XSS, SQL Injection).
CSRF Protection (Tokens for all forms).
Rate Limiting (Prevent spam & brute-force attacks).
Session Security (Regenerate session IDs on login).
âœ… Performance Optimization
Use indexes on frequently queried columns.
Optimize database queries (Use JOIN instead of multiple queries).
Use caching for commonly accessed data (Memcached/Redis).
Lazy load images & threads for faster page load.
ðŸ“Œ Phase 7: Final Testing & Deployment
Mission Objective: Prepare EchoForum for live users.

âœ… Pre-Launch Checklist
Test all features (Signup, Login, Posting, Replies, Upvotes, Notifications).
Run security tests (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF attacks).
Test on multiple devices (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).
Optimize database queries & clean unused code.
âœ… Deployment Plan
Use GitHub for version control.
Deploy on a cloud server (DigitalOcean/VPS).
Enable HTTPS for security.
Setup automated database backups.
ðŸ“Œ Final Summary
We are building EchoForum the right way, following industry best practices, security standards, and scalability optimizations.

âœ… No rushed developmentâ€”only structured, professional-grade implementation.
âœ… You write the code, I review & correct where necessary.
âœ… We ensure security, scalability, and maintainability.
